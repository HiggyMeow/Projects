ALL EXCEPT WEB DESIGN
**How they connect:**
Yes, a data analyst's role is strongly connected to programming, which is used for handling large datasets, automating tasks, and performing complex analysis and visualization. While some entry-level roles may rely more on tools like Excel or Tableau, a strong foundation in programming languages like SQL and Python is essential for efficiency and advanced work, especially as datasets grow. 
Yes, data analysts extensively use SQL (Structured Query Language) to connect with and interact with data. SQL is a fundamental tool for data analysts for several key reasons
Data analysts and web designers are distinct but collaborative roles, where data analysts provide insights into user behavior to improve a website's design and user experience. While data analysts focus on analyzing website metrics and trends, web designers use this data to make informed decisions about site structure, navigation, and overall user interface.
AI connects with data analysts by automating routine tasks, providing faster processing, and uncovering patterns, which enhances their ability to focus on higher-level strategic thinking. Instead of replacing analysts, AI acts as a collaborative tool, with the analyst using their critical thinking and contextual understanding to validate AI-driven insights and drive business decisions. This creates a symbiotic relationship where data analysts can leverage AI to amplify their impact.
